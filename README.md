## Interactive Graphics Project

Project for the Interactive Graphics class of AI & Robotics at Sapienza University of Rome, by Pasquale Silvestri and Marco Lo Pinto.\
The game is a first person shooter, You are an agent training in a very realistic disaster simulator! Get to the end of the simulation without getting killed by rogue robots or exploding on some weirdly misplaced exploding barrels (Why are there gas barrels again?)
